The fitted regression equations predict that the average time for production of the second cone on a plant would be 8.3 years TSLF for B. ericifolia , 4.5 years for B. marginata and 4.3 years for P. pulchella . These can be considered as minimum estimates of the earliest useful contributions to an accumulating seedbank. However, it is likely to be an under-estimate for B. marginata because no 5-year-old site was sampled, and this affects the shape of the relevant part of the fitted regression. Indeed, a linear regression fits the B. marginata data just as well as does the non-linear one (this is not true for either the B. ericifolia or P. pulchella data), and this predicts that second cone production on a plant would occur at an average of 6.7 years TSLF, which we consider to be a more realistic estimate for this species.

The relatively consistent position where the new cones occurred implies that each branch must reach a certain maturity before it can produce flowers. Here, P. pulchella primarily produced cones on whorls 2 years in age, whilst the two Banksia species showed production of new cones over a small range of growth whorls, with B. marginata producing new cones primarily on 3â€“4-year-old growth whorls and B. ericifolia producing most new cones on growth whorls 5 years in age. The positioning of cones with respect to growth whorls seemed to display a similar trend across all TSLF ages and geographical locations. However, our quantitative observations contrast with results that reported new cones on 1â€“3-year-old whorls in B. ericifolia ( George 1981 ; Zammit & Westoby 1988 ).

Both Banksia species produced substantial numbers (from 10â€“50%) of cones with no apparent reproductive value ( Fig. 3 ). For the accumulated cones (i.e. those produced in previous years), neither species showed any significant trend with plant age in the proportion of fertile/barren cones ( B. ericifolia , Ï‡ 2 = 8.91, P = 0.113; B. marginata , Ï‡ 2 = 6.08, P = 0.299).

When estimating the juvenile periods of obligate-seeder species, we suggest that it is advantageous to slightly over-estimate than to under-estimate, because regeneration may not occur if erratic production of cones occurs or low fruit numbers are set in the first few years of reproduction. Certain fire regimes are known to cause local extinction of species, as in the case when multiple fires occur during the juvenile period ( Hammill et al. 1998 ). Bradstock & Oâ€™Connell (1988) found that seeds could be available at 6 years TSLF in B. ericifolia and 5 years in P. pulchella , and replacement would then be possible if seedling establishment after fire was very high. They suggested that fire-free intervals of 8â€“10 years would be tolerated without any population decline, but a 13-year inter-fire period would be needed for persistence if establishment of', metadata={'source': 'articles/10.1101_001867.txt'}), Document(page_content='was observed to start cone production in 7-year-old populations, whilst B. ericifolia and P. pulchella began flowering at 5 years TSLF (no 5-year-old site was sampled for B. marginata ).

From our results, a minimum fire-free period of greater than 10 years may be necessary for worthwhile fruit initiation in all three study species, as our estimated average time for production of a second cone on a plant, which seems to coincide with initial production of follicles/bracts, was 8.3 years for B. ericifolia , 6.7 years for B. marginata and 4.3 years for P. pulchella . The primary juvenile periods have been reported to be 6â€“8 and 5â€“9 years for B. ericifolia and P. pulchella respectively ( Myerscough et al. 2000 ), which is consistent with our estimates.

Each symbol represents a population value with binomial standard errors, and the B. ericifolia data have been separated into the current seasonâ€™s cones (open symbols) and older cones (filled symbols). The average number of fruits per cone was calculated for the Banksia species using only the cones that produced follicles, due to the high percentages of barren cones, and using all cones for P. pulchella ( Table 2 ). Both Banksia species showed a significant difference in the average number of fruits produced per cone with respect to plant age ( Table 3 ), with a greater number of fruits per cone at 15â€“20 years TSLF ( Table 2 ).

The slightly poorer correlation value and the lesser variability for B. marginata are both consistent with the more-linear increase in cone production noted above. There were no detectable differences in fruit production between the northern and southern sites of the same TSLF age for either B. ericifolia or P. pulchella ( Fig. 1 ). The growth-position of the newly produced cones varied between the species ( Fig. 2 ), although all three species preferentially produced the cones on younger whorls.

      "The tRNA genes in Metazoan mitochondria have proved to be problematic because they often vary in number, with some genes missing or duplicated, and also vary in the secondary structure of the transcribed tRNAs, including missing T or D arms. This variability makes it difficult to locate all of the genes within the mitogenome and to precisely annotate their 5â€² and 3â€² boundaries. The standard cloverleaf-shaped secondary structure may lack one of the cloverleaf arms, and the structure and number of tRNAs can differ both between tRNA types and between taxonomic groups. Additionally, this variability has led to a lack of understanding of how these mitochondrial tRNAs function compared to the more standardized nuclear tRNAs. Such problems with annotation and identification of tRNA genes result in missed genes, wrongly annotated locations, false complements, and inconsistent criteria for assigning the 5â€² and 3â€² boundaries in the databased mitogenome sequences.\n",
